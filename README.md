## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static type checking
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) - Test runner

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to create a responsive website using React, Vite, and TailwindCSS. I also learned how to handle keyboard events for navigation, as seen in the `keyboardHandler` function in the [Hero.tsx](#file:hero.tsx-context) file. This function allows users to navigate the slider using their keyboard.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to continue developing my skills in React and TypeScript. I also want to explore more about testing with Vitest and how it can help improve the quality of my code.

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - This helped me understand React better.
- [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - This is an amazing tool that helped me set up my project quickly.
- [TailwindCSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - I used this for styling my project.
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - This provided me with a lot of useful information about TypeScript.
- [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/) - This helped me set up and write tests for my project.
